# SwiftQiskitWalkDemo

Generated from the **Quantum Algorithm App** Xcode template. A multiplatform SwiftUI app
linked to the local `SwiftQiskit` package, prefilled with a discrete-time quantum walk —
ported from `SwiftQiskit/Playgrounds.playground/Pages/22Walk.xcplaygroundpage`.

## Layout

- `QuantumWalk.swift` — the algorithm itself. Pure math over SwiftQiskitCore's `Matrix` and
  `StateVector`; no SwiftUI import, so it can be reasoned about and tested independent of the
  view layer.
- `AlgorithmModel.swift` — the view model. `@MainActor @Observable`, holding the algorithm's
  inputs (`steps`, `symmetricCoin`) and recomputing its outputs (`quantumDistribution`,
  `classicalDistribution`, `quantumSigma`, `classicalSigma`) on `didSet`.
- `DistributionChartView.swift` — plots the two distributions with Swift Charts.
- `ContentView.swift` — controls (a steps stepper, a coin toggle), the chart, and a σ summary.
- `SwiftQiskitWalkDemoApp.swift` — the `@main` entry point.
- `SwiftQiskitWalkDemoTests/AlgorithmTests.swift` — checks the walk's invariants: the shift
  operator is unitary, distributions stay normalized, the classical walk is diffusive
  (σ/√t ≈ 1), the quantum walk is ballistic (σ grows faster), and the `|+i⟩` coin gives a
  distribution symmetric about the start site while `|0⟩` does not.

## Porting a different SwiftQiskit playground algorithm

1. Replace `QuantumWalk.swift` with a plain struct wrapping the target playground page's
   math — see `SwiftQiskit/PlaygroundDocs/*PLAN.md` for the derivation behind each page, and
   `SwiftQiskit/Playgrounds.playground/Pages/` for the runnable original.
2. Update `AlgorithmModel`'s inputs and outputs to match the new algorithm's parameters and
   results.
3. Adjust `DistributionChartView` — rename it if the new algorithm doesn't produce a
   distribution over discrete positions (e.g. a VQE energy sweep is a single curve over a
   continuous parameter, not two histograms).
4. Update `ContentView`'s controls and narration.
5. Update `AlgorithmTests` to check the new algorithm's invariants — usually the same
   assertions the playground page's own "Expected:" comments describe.

## Requirement: sibling checkout

This project references the `SwiftQiskit` package at the relative path `../SwiftQiskit` — it
must sit next to a `SwiftQiskit` checkout, exactly like `SwiftQiskitApp` itself.
